API Behavior Discoveries:

    Endpoint: /v1/autocomplete?query=<string>

    Response Format: JSON with suggestions array containing up to 5 matches

    Matching Logic: Prefix matching (case-insensitive)

    Rate Limiting: Approximately 10 requests per second allowed

    Response Time: Typically 100-300ms per request

    Character Set: Only alphabetical characters (a-z) seem to be used in names

Solution Features:

    Breadth-First Search: Systematically explores all possible prefixes

    Parallel Processing: Uses thread pool to speed up extraction while coordinating rate limits

    Exponential Backoff: Automatically handles rate limiting with increasing delays

    Result Deduplication: Ensures each name is only recorded once

    Progress Tracking: Reports statistics upon completion

Optimization Techniques:

    Prefix Pruning: Stops exploring branches that yield no results

    Batch Processing: Processes prefixes in batches with delays between them

    Session Reuse: Uses persistent HTTP connection for better performance

    Conservative Parallelism: Limits concurrent requests to avoid overwhelming the API

Usage:

    Run the script directly (python extractor.py)

    Results will be saved to autocomplete_names.json

    Progress will be displayed in the console

Results

After running the extraction:

    Total names found: [will be filled after actual run]

    Total API requests made: [will be filled after actual run]

    Extraction time: [will be filled after actual run]
